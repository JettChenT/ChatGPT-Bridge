## Prerequisites

Before you proceed, please ensure the following software is installed on your system and added to the system path:

1. **sed for Windows**: A stream editor for filtering and transforming text. Download the installer from [SourceForge](https://freefr.dl.sourceforge.net/project/gnuwin32/sed/4.2.1/sed-4.2.1-setup.exe) and add the installation path (usually `C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuWin32\bin`) to the system path.

2. **7-Zip**: A file archiver with a high compression ratio. Download the installer from the [official website](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) and install the appropriate version (32-bit or 64-bit) for your system. After installation, add the installation path (usually `C:\Program Files\7-Zip` or `C:\Program Files (x86)\7-Zip`) to the system path.

3. **jq.exe**: A lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. Download the Windows binary from the [official GitHub releases page](https://github.com/stedolan/jq/releases) and save it in a directory on your system. Add the directory containing `jq.exe` to the system path.

After installing the required software, make sure to restart your command prompt or terminal for the updated system path to take effect.
