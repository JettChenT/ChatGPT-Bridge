Tired of waiting for access to the GPT-4 API? Frustrated by the fees charged for using the GPT-API? We have the perfect solution for you!
-------------------------------------------
Introducing **ChatGPT-Driver**, a system comprised of two components: **ChatGPT-Bridge** (referred to as **"Bridge"**) and **[ChatGPT-Executor](https://github.com/improveTheWorld/ChatGPT-Executor)**  (referred to as **"Executor"**). 
**Bridge** is a web browser plugin compatible with Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome. It offers API-like access to **ChatGPT**. When combined with **Executor** ( which  is a server application that receives and executes Windows commands), they unlock the full potential of ChatGPT without any waiting list or additional fees.

**Bridge** offers API-like access to GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for third-party softwares via webSockets. 
Bridge provides free API-like access to GPT-3.5. It Also provides free API-like access to GPT-4 if you have a ChatGPT Plus account. 
 **‚ú® üéâüåü  No fees are charged for the use of the API-like access !**

To fully benefit from ChatGPT-Driver, install and set up both components

## üîß Installation and Usage

To utilize ChatGPT-Driver, you'll need to install both the ChatGPT-Bridge plugin and the ChatGPT-Executor server application.

### ChatGPT-Bridge

Follow the instructions in the [Getting Started](https://github.com/improveTheWorld/ChatGPT-Bridge#getting-started) section to install the ChatGPT-Bridge plugin.

### ChatGPT-Executor

1.  Visit the ChatGPT-Executor [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/improveTheWorld/ChatGPT-Executor) and follow the installation instructions.
2.  Set up the ChatGPT-Executor server application according to the provided documentation.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Microsoft Edge or  Google Chrome browser
- Basic understanding of browser extensions

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/improveTheWorld/ChatGPT-Bridge.git
    
2. Open your browser and navigate to extensions ( `edge://extensions` or `chrome://extensions` depending on your browser).

3. Enable "Developer Mode" in the top-right corner.

4. Click on "Load Unpacked" and select the `chatgpt-bridge` folder.

5. The ChatGPT-Bridge plugin should now be visible in the extensions list and ready for use!

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

1. After installing the plugin, go to [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) website, click the plugin button on the top part of the browser to open a popup with two buttons: "Start" to initiate bridging with the third-party software, and "Stop" to end the connection.

2. The default WebSocket communication is done over port 8181. You can change the port in the config.json file if necessary.

3. Two modes of communication are available:

   - Wait for a complete GPT message before sending it to the third-party software (default mode)
   - Stream the message while it's being received from GPT (enable this by setting "streamingMode": true in the config.json file)
