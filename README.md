# Tired of waiting for access to the GPT-4 API? Frustrated by the fees charged for using the GPT-API? We have the perfect solution for you!

Introducing **[ChatGPT-Driver](https://youtu.be/9fCtMJQxQ4c)**, a system comprised of two components: **ChatGPT-Bridge** (referred to as **"Bridge"**) and **[ChatGPT-Executor](https://github.com/improveTheWorld/ChatGPT-Executor)**  (referred to as **"Executor"**).
**Bridge** is a web browser plugin compatible with Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome. It offers API-like access to **ChatGPT**. When combined with **Executor** (a server application that receives and executes Windows commands), they unlock the full potential of ChatGPT without any waiting list or additional fees.

**Bridge** offers API-like access to GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for third-party software via webSockets.
Bridge provides free API-like access to GPT-3.5. It also provides free API-like access to GPT-4 if you have a ChatGPT Plus account.
**‚ú® üéâüåü No fees are charged for the use of the API-like access!**

We are continuously striving to maintain and improve this project. If you love our work and find it useful, consider supporting us. Every small donation will go a long way in helping us to keep this project alive and free. **üíå[Donate Here](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=SJTG7U2E6PC4W)üíå**

To fully benefit from ChatGPT-Driver, install and set up both components.

## üîß Installation and Usage

To utilize ChatGPT-Driver, you'll need to install both the Bridge plugin and the Executor server application.

### ChatGPT-Bridge

Follow the instructions in the [Getting Started](https://github.com/improveTheWorld/ChatGPT-Bridge#getting-started) section to install the Bridge plugin.

### ChatGPT-Executor

You can download and install ChatGPT-Executor-1.2.0 directly from [Here](https://bit.ly/46rz4zE). For more information you may visit the [Executor GitHub Repository](https://github.com/improveTheWorld/ChatGPT-Executor) and follow the instructions.
You also can download the correct version of ChatGPT-Executor which is compatible of your ChatGPT-Bridge version , from the ChatGPT-Bridge popup.
1. click on Entensions button ( on the top left corner of your web navigator) :

![popup_1.png](./src/assets/Usage/popup_1.png)

2. From displayed the entension list , select the chatGPT-Bridge, the popup will be displayed

![popup._2.png](./src/assets/Usage/popup_2.png)


here is how to display the ChatGPT-Bridge  popup :

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome browser
- Basic understanding of browser extensions

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/improveTheWorld/ChatGPT-Bridge.git
   
2. Open your browser and navigate to extensions ( `edge://extensions` or `chrome://extensions` depending on your browser).
3. Enable "Developer Mode" in the top-right corner.
4. Click on "Load Unpacked" and select the `ChatGPT-Bridge/src` folder.
5. The ChatGPT-Bridge plugin should now be visible in the extensions list and ready for use!

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

1. After installing the plugin, go to [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) website.
2. The bridge popup will be displayed at the top right corner of the webpage. You may move it using your mouse if needed.

* If the displayed popup is as below:

  ![Connecting.GIF](./src/assets/Usage/Connecting.GIF)

  `You forgot to launch the Executor or your third-party server, if applicable. Please start the Executor and wait. The Bridge will continuously poll for a connection until it is established.`
* When the connection is established, the displayed popup should be as below:

  ![Start.GIF](./src/assets/Usage/Start.GIF)

  Start a new chat and then click the start button to begin bridging between your ChatGPT AI and the third-party software (the Executor).

  When you click start with a new chat page, the Bridge plugin will empty the first prompt and send it. The first prompt is intended to teach CHATGPT the communication protocol to use with the Executor.

  Once ChatGPT gets all the initial instructions, it will ask you for its first task. Assign one and watch the magic work.

  `As an example of use, we asked ChatGPT to troubleshoot our WiFi card. We had an issue that the Windows network diagnostic tools were unable to detect. ChatGPT, after trying different approaches using our ChatGPT-Bridge system, was able to fix it for us.`[Video](https://youtu.be/9fCtMJQxQ4c)

  ---
* When you are done and want to stop using the bridge, just click the stop button:

  ![Stop.GIF](./src/assets/Usage/Stop.GIF)

3. The default WebSocket communication between the Bridge and the third-party software is done over port 8181. You can change the port in the config.json file if needed.
4. You can find the initial prompt text in the file firstPrompt.txt. You may customize it for your personal needs if you want.
5. Two modes of communication are available:

   * Wait for a complete GPT message before sending it to the third-party software (default mode).
   * Stream the message while it's being received from GPT (enable this by setting "streamingMode": true in the config.json file).
6. If you want to use only the Bridge plugin with your third-party software, your software should act as a server and listen on the correct port for a connection. Once the plugin is installed and launched, it will automatically request a connection.

**FROM VERSION 1.1.0 AND LATER**

If you are using a ChatGPT Plus account, a countdown of available message credits will be displayed once you start using GPT-4 (as only 25 messages per 3 hours are allowed).  

  ![Stop.GIF](./src/assets/Usage/CountDown.GIF)

  The countdown will also display a timer counting down until the message credits are refilled
