# ChatGPT-Bridge

**Tired of waiting for access to GPT-4 API?!! Here‚Äôs the solution!**

ChatGPT-Bridge is an experimental Microsoft Edge plugin designed to seamlessly integrate ChatGPT with third-party software. It achieves this by intercepting ChatGPT messages, transmitting them over a WebSocket, receiving the response from the third-party software, and injecting the answer back into the chat session. This process empowers ChatGPT with a vast array of applications and unlocks its full potential.

This plugin provides API-like access to GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 without the need for a long waiting period. ChatGPT-Bridge offers free access to GPT-3.5 AI, while using it with GPT-4 requires a ChatGPT Plus account but incurs no additional fees.

This plugin is part of an upcoming project, which gives ChatGPT access to the Windows prompt to execute commands necessary for completing tasks assigned to it by the user, thus unlocking unlimited capabilities of ChatGPT - **stay tuned!**

**Note:** Since ChatGPT-Bridge is still in the experimental stage, there may be potential bugs and limitations. We appreciate your understanding and welcome any feedback to help us improve the plugin.

## üåü Features

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Microsoft Edge browser
- Basic understanding of browser extensions

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/improveTheWorld/ChatGPT-Bridge.git
    
2. Open Microsoft Edge and navigate to `edge://extensions`.

3. Enable "Developer Mode" in the top-right corner.

4. Click on "Load Unpacked" and select the `chatgpt-bridge` folder.

5. The ChatGPT-Bridge plugin should now be visible in the extensions list and ready for use!

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

1. After installing the plugin, go to [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) website, click the plugin button on the top part of the browser to open a popup with two buttons: "Start" to initiate bridging with the third-party software, and "Stop" to end the connection.

2. The default WebSocket communication is done over port 8181. You can change the port in the config.json file if necessary.

3. Two modes of communication are available:

   - Wait for a complete GPT message before sending it to the third-party software (default mode)
   - Stream the message while it's being received from GPT (enable this by setting "streamingMode": true in the config.json file)
